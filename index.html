Dear Teachers!  Answer.ky is sad to announce that we will shut down our product starting May 2017.  Both founder Mike Xia and Kael Greco worked countless hours with teachers to build a great automation product, but we were never able to generate enough sales traction with K12 institutions.  Sad to go but we'll be moving on to new adventures.
